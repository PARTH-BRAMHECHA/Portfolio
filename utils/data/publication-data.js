    shortDescription:
      "Introduces IndicShield, a multilingual safety dataset and guardrail model for Indic languages, enabling culturally-aware LLM alignment through adversarial data generation, code-mixed augmentation, and multilingual fine-tuning.",
    longDescription: `
IndicShield presents a comprehensive framework for building culturally-aware safety guardrails for Large Language Models across Indic languages.

The work addresses the lack of multilingual safety resources by introducing a high-quality benchmark dataset and guard models that capture region-specific cultural norms, code-mixed communication, and adversarial prompting.

Key Contributions:
• Creation of the IndicShield multilingual safety dataset
• Translation and reconstruction pipeline for multiple Indic languages
• Culture-aware augmentation using LLMs
• Human-in-the-loop validation for high-quality annotations
• Support for adversarial prompts, jailbreak attacks, and code-mixed inputs
• Fine-tuning multilingual safety guard models for content moderation

The proposed models are evaluated on standard safety benchmarks along with culturally grounded Indic datasets, demonstrating improved robustness and multilingual safety alignment. IndicShield provides an open foundation for developing safer and more inclusive LLMs for Indian languages and multilingual applications.

    shortDescription:
      "A Quantum Inspired Causal XAI framework enhances Counterparty Credit Risk prediction by combining quantum embeddings, causal learning, and concept-level explainability for accurate and interpretable insights.",
    longDescription: `
Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR) in networked financial systems requires solutions that balance predictive accuracy with interpretability. Standard machine learning models, though effective in prediction, often lack transparency and fail to capture causal relationships.

We propose a Quantum Inspired Causal Explainable AI (XAI) framework integrating:
• Random Fourier-based quantum embeddings  
• Causal graph learning  
• Concept-level explainability via TCAV  

A Random Forest classifier, trained on a SMOTE-resampled subset of the Home Credit Default Risk dataset, is evaluated under simulated macroeconomic stress conditions.

The approach reveals interpretable risk transmission channels, preserves predictive robustness, and addresses key shortcomings of prior XAI methods. This provides regulators and institutions with causally grounded, actionable insights for improved CCR assessment.

    title: "Driver Fatigue Detection",

    shortDescription:
      "A hybrid decision-making system using deep learning and geometric features for more reliable fatigue detection.",
    longDescription: `
This work presents a real-time hybrid driver fatigue detection system designed for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices such as the Raspberry Pi. The system combines the strengths of lightweight CNN-based eye state classification with geometric facial landmark analysis for yawn detection, enabling reliable and efficient multi-modal fatigue assessment.

The pipeline integrates facial landmark extraction, CNN-driven feature learning, geometric metrics (EAR, MAR, and head orientation), and a fusion-based decision engine to significantly reduce false positives while maintaining high sensitivity in real-world conditions.

Training was performed using large-scale eye and yawn datasets (~500k images) with extensive preprocessing and augmentation to ensure robustness across diverse lighting and environmental scenarios. The models were optimized for edge inference, achieving 60 FPS on Raspberry Pi 4B with less than 80% system utilization.

Performance:
• Eye state detection accuracy: 98.34%  
• Yawn detection accuracy: 96.84%  
• Hybrid model: Improved stability and reduced false alarms compared to single-modality methods  

The resulting system demonstrates strong applicability for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), delivering dependable fatigue monitoring suitable for real-time driver safety applications.

      "Explores how data preprocessing, transformation, and mining combined with the RFM model improve customer segmentation.",
    longDescription: `
    This work presents a structured data processing and mining framework built around the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to achieve high-quality customer segmentation. The approach integrates end-to-end preprocessing—including data cleaning, standardization, transformation, and missing-value handling—with analytical scoring techniques to generate reliable customer profiles.

    Using transactional data, RFM metrics are computed and converted into ranked scores, enabling objective customer evaluation. These scores are further leveraged for pattern discovery using data mining techniques, revealing natural customer clusters and behavior-based segments such as Champions, Loyal Customers, Potential Loyalists, and At-Risk groups.
   
    The study highlights how combining classical analytics with disciplined preprocessing significantly improves segmentation accuracy, enhances marketing decision-making, and supports customer-centric business strategies. The methodology demonstrates a practical and scalable workflow suitable for real-world CRM and business intelligence applications.
